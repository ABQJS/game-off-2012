# MUDnode something something

This is a game. It's kind of like a MUD. It has something about forks or branches or cloning or pushing or pulling. Still figuring out that part.

## Getting started
* Clone the repo
* `git submodule update --init --recursive`
* `npm install`
* `node server`
* Horse Dance! (haaaaaaaaaaaaay sexxxay lady!)
